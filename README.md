Make sure Node.js is installed on your device. You can open the command terminal and enter "node -v" to check if node is installed. If the command terminal responds back with a version of Node, then it is installed. Otherwise, go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and download the LTS version of Node for the appropriate OS that you are using (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.).

Open the command terminal (if you haven't already done so). Enter "node index.js" to initiate the README file generator.

## How to use this project

After initiating the README file generator, you will be expected to answer a few prompts.

When you reach the prompt, "Choose a license for your project:", you may select as many licenses as you wish by using the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys to navigate the list and pressing the "Space" key to add them. After making your selections, press the "Enter" key.

NOTE: If a license is not necessary, then you can just press the "Enter" key without selecting any licenses.

When finished answering all prompts, a README.md file is created using the info you provided.
